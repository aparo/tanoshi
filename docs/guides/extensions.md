# Extensions

By default tanoshi only support to read locally available manga specified in `local_path` in `config.yml`. To browse and read manga from external source, tanoshi needs extensions. Extensions can be donwnloaded from [here](https://github.com/fadhlika/tanoshi-extensions) in `repo` branch. 

You can download individual plugins and store in on your selected `plugins_path` in `config.yml`, or clone `repo` branch and copy all of plugins to `plugins_path`, or you can install from web.
