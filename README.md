Tachiyomi-like web manga reader.

## Goals
After switching to iOS from android, I really missing tachiyomi for reading manga.
Because I can't afford to pay for annual fee of app store, 
I decided to make this a PWA instead with web scraping on backend.

## Features
### Currently working
- Browse, search, and read manga from mangasee
- Favorite mangas
- Reading history across devices
- See chapter updates
- Read in single page, double page, or long strip
- Read from right to left or left to right
### Planned
I'm trying to make this as close as tachiyomi, and add sync across device as well.

## Why Rust
Rust is the most loved programming language, I thought this is my chance to learn rust too.

## Deploy
Use [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) to deploy
